The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and is more commonly referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2017.
